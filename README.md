## **Procedure**

### **1. Check Content Upgrade Status**
- The playbook sends an XML command to the firewall to check the current content update status.
- If the check fails, it sets a fact with an error message and continues execution.

### **2. Download Content Upgrade**
- If updates are available, the playbook downloads the latest content upgrade.
- The download status and job ID are captured for further verification.

### **3. Check Content Upgrade Status After Download**
- After downloading the update, the playbook verifies the content update status again.
- It checks if the downloaded version matches the target version.

### **4. Install Latest Content Upgrade**
- If the downloaded version is not already installed, the playbook installs it.
- The installation status and job ID are captured for further verification.

### **5. Send Email Notification**
- After completing the content update process, the playbook sends an email report.
- The email includes details such as the latest version, release date, download status, and current status.
